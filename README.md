ExifPro is an image browser application that can help you display, describe, tag, and manipulate your collection of photographs.

ExifPro offers several view modes like thumbnails, previews, or image details. Selected images may be copied, resized, cropped, rotated, renamed, and adjusted. ExifPro can present information embedded in photographs (EXIF metadata) describing different parameters used by digital cameras while taking shots. One can create HTML albums or slide shows using built-in generators, print images, append descriptions, and tags, automatically rename and transfer photographs.

Viewer window provides zooming and panning, image color and aspect correction, light table, and a slide show.
